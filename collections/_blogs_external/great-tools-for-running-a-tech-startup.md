To run a successful tech company, you need to use the right tools to bring success to yourself and your customers. We often get asked by our customers and developers around the world about what tools we use at RavSam. In this blog, we will talk about some of the best tools to increase team productivity within the organization.

We can achieve even more profit by connecting these tools. For example, we can create a Slack bot that creates a Typeform and send it to your customers via Send with Us. Such workflows can be designed using Zapier or Google Apps Script.

[1\. Send with Us](https://www.dyspatch.io/sendwithus/)

Every company does email marketing. It is a great way to reach out to your users and leads. But how do you ensure that your email template is responsive and optimized for all screens? **Send with Us** is a great service by [Dyspatch.io](https://www.dyspatch.io/sendwithus/). It allows you to build email design, templates, and AMP as well.

[2\. Loom](https://www.loom.com/)
---------------------------------

Loom is a great product that allows you to record video messages of your screen, camera, or both at the same time. It can be hugely beneficial when you have to send a report to the customer. You can record yourself explaining the report metrics which allows the customer to understand it better.

[3\. Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/)
-----------------------------------------

**Typeform** is the best service in the world for building forms and surveys in no time. Good looking forms help keeps the audience engaged. We get more thoughtful responses and higher completion rates. The best part is that non-developer team member s can easily create forms on their own.

[4\. Zapier](https://www.zapier.com/)
-------------------------------------

**Zapier** allows you to connect apps and create automation workflows by sending data to form one endpoint to the other. It allows you to create a **Zap** in the form of a trigger, condition, and action.

[5\. Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/)

Intercom is more than just a chat widget. It’s a full customer service suite that can be integrated into any digital product you want. It aims to give customers a conversational experience they’ll remember - and come back for.

[6\. Slack](https://www.slack.com/)
-----------------------------------

There is no life without **Slack**. It is not only great for internal organization communication, but also for building **bots**, which can be used to automate processes and do other cool stuff.

[7\. Apps Script](https://www.google.com/script/start/)
-------------------------------------------------------

**Google Apps Script** is a Javascript-based development platform that allows you to connect applications that integrate with G Suite. Authentication is baked right into the platform so that the developers don’t have to deal with access keys and tokens. We use Google Apps Script extensively in developer workflows at RavSam.

Cheers!
