Flutter is one of the fastest rising frameworks for developing cross-platform applications. At RavSam, we also use Flutter for [mobile app development](https://www.ravsam.in/services/mobile-app-development/) services. One of the biggest advantages of Flutter is its plugin ecosystem. There are tons of plugins available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/) build by the community that can be integrated right on the go with our Flutter apps. In this article, we will take a look at some of those plugins which can be used almost in any Flutter app and enhance the User Experience to a great extent.

This plugin provides the developers with a great way to distinguish between Mobile and WiFi connection. According to its developers, a backward-compatible 1.0.0 version will be released soon as the plugin has reached a stable API.
