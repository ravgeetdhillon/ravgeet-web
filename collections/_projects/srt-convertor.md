I made this tool to reduce my screen time and extract something from something really valuable. A lot of times, I had to watch tutorials about different things which are 30 to 45 minutes long. The only thing that matters is the vocal content and rest is just garbage. If I view this on Youtube, it wastes a lot of bandwidth. So what I do this is I get a `.srt` format transcript of the video and input it into this SRT Convertor. It gives me back clean and filtered file with only important textual information. So if you ever felt like the need to have a tool that can do the above, feel free to fork it from the below given GitHub repository.
