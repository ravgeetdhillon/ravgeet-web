SteerAI is a machine learning project to achieve the ambition of self-driving cars. Me and my couple of friends worked on this project during our Machine Learning course and we achieved some significant progress as well. You can read more about the project through [this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/ravgeetdhillon/steerAI/blob/master/self_driving.ipynb).
