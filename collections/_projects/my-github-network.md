This is one of my weekend projects that I like the most. What it does is, it takes your github username as an input and gives as output your github network comprising of your followers, and then their respective followers. It uses D3.js to create the graph and github API to get the information regarding the user. The backend is written in PHP and the web app is hosted on Heroku. Click on the view link beneath to get a taste. All you need is your github username.
