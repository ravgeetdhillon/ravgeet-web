    ## üòÑ About Me

    I am a **Full-Stack Developer** and **Technical Content Writer** based in India üáÆüá≥.

    I run my one-man Digital Product Development agency, [RavSam](https://www.ravsam.in), via which I provide my **freelance services** to **startups** and **businesses** around the globe.

    I am currently **pursuing my Masters in Computer Science and Engineering** at Guru Nanak Dev University and will be post-graduating in 2022.

    ## üë®‚Äçüíª Full Stack Development

    I provide my freelance services to clients all over the world via my [Full Stack Development agency](https://www.ravsam.in). My first large-scale project was the revamp of the [GTK website](https://gtk.org) which I did as Google Summer of Code Developer. It was [greatly appreciated](https://twitter.com/GTKtoolkit/status/1230167481228107776) by the open-source community.

    Since then, I have worked with many startups and made digital products for them.
    Currently, I am working with [CloudAnswers](https://cloudanswers.com) as a Full Stack Developer and Consultant on contract basis. I am also passionate about design and user experience.
