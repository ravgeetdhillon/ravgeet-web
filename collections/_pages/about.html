  ## üòÑ Story

  I was born on **19 April 1998** in **Amritsar, Punjab, India**.
  
  I did my schooling at **Manav Public School** in my hometown.
  
  Ever since I was young, I was fascinated by computers maybe because **my father was a software engineer**. I made a **Railway Ticket Booking system** in Visual Basics when I was in sixth grade. That is my first memory of writing code.
  
  In school, I was excellent at Mathematics **scored 99/100** in my board exams. I enjoyed Mathematics because, unlike other subjects, **I didn't have to cram it**. It was more about understanding the problem and then solving it. So, I decided to do my graduation in Mathematics.
  
  My father was not against this decision, but he advised me to pursue graduation with a professional degree, in case you don't get a job, you can start your own business. With a little reluctance, I joined **B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering at Guru Nanak Dev University in 2016**.
  
  Within two months, I realized that instead of crying over the spilt milk, I need to put my effort into what I am doing right. I am not going to blame someone else for my failure.
  
  During the first semester of my graduation, I learnt about **Python** and started enjoying it. I quickly realized that Mathematics and Programming are very similar with **equations** in former replaced with **instructions** in latter with the end goal of solving a given problem.
  
  During the third year of my graduation, I got selected as a **Google Summer of Code Developer for GNOME foundation** where I revamped the [GTK website](https://gtk.org) using Jekyll. This project was a turning point in my career as I got introduced to some of the best software engineers in the world. I learnt a lot of things like good coding practices, technical writing, open-source maintenance. I was invited to **speak at the GUADEC conference in Greece** but due to some visa issues, I couldn't attend the conference.
  
  Thanks to this project, I started receiving a lot of roles for internships, jobs, and other gigs that you expect from a software developer. I took only those tasks that didn't require a full-time commitment and **started doing freelancing**.
  
  In the fourth year of my graduation, I sat down one day and started to think about where I am going the take my life. Am I going the work for somebody else or do something that I love? Am I going to do a **9-5 office job** or take control of my time and do whatever I want? The answers to these questions weren't clear but I soon realized that **teaching** - whether verbal or written - is the thing that I love the most.
  
  The **passion for teaching** emerged when I was the **part of the Computer Engineering Student Society** at my University. I **taught Web Development to my juniors** and they gave great feedback. They acknowledged my teaching skills that how I can teach a complex topic with ease.
  
  So, I finally decided to **pursue a career** which will help me become a teacher but at the same time allow me to do other things like freelancing, consulting, technical content writing and more.
  
  So instead of taking up the job offer that I was offered at the end of my graduation, I decided to pursue **Masters in Computer Science and Engineering**. I started my post-graduation in 2020 at Guru Nanak Dev University.
  
  At the same time, I started my freelance digital product development agency, [RavSam](https://www.ravsam.in). Since then, I have worked with promising businesses and startups and provided them with [Full Stack Development services](https://www.ravsam.in/services/). I also do **Technical Content Writing** for CSS Tricks, Vonage, ATA, HitSubscribe and recently Twilio.
  
  I know that life is unpredictable and a lot of things can change in a small period but I always keep in mind that
