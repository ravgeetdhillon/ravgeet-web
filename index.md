Hello! I'm Ravgeet Dhillon and I develop exciting things that run on Web. I see myself as a Web Developer who creates best of the experiences for the people whenever he develops something new.

I currently live in Amritsar, Punjab, India and pursing my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from Guru Nanak Dev University.

For now, I'm working as a GSoC Intern for [GNOME][gnome]. My task during Summer 2019 is to redesign and redevelop the GTK's official website. You can check my ongoing work [here][gtk]. GTK is the UI toolkit used by millions of developers around the world to create UI systems for Linux apps.

I use my time making [music][youtube], taking [photographs][gallery] and writing quality [code][github]. I also write a [blog][blog] where I share my knowledge about technologies I work with, places I travel and things that can help make this world a better place for all. If you have any project that I can craft for you, then you can contact me through my [email][email].
