**Full-Stack Developer** and **Technical Content Writer** based in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³

Currently, I am working with [CloudAnswers](https://cloudanswers.com) where I design and develop frontend systems in React and Next.js and integrate them with the Salesforce APIs. Additionally, I work on AI and productivity tools.

Outside of tech, I enjoy playing chess, admiring beautifully designed buildings, and spending time cooking.
