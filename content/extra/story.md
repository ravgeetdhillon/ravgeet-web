I was born on **19 April 1998** in the holy city of **Amritsar, Punjab, India**.

I did my schooling at **Manav Public School** in my hometown.

Ever since I was young, I was fascinated by computers maybe because **my father was a software engineer**. The sound of mechanical keyboards was music to my ear and I would press keys for fun. I made a **Railway Ticket Booking system** in Visual Basics when I was in sixth grade. That is my first memory of writing code.

In school, I was excellent at Mathematics and **scored 99/100** in my final high school exams. I enjoyed Mathematics because, unlike other subjects, **I didn't have to cram it**. It was more about understanding the problem and then solving it. So, I thought of doing my graduation in Mathematics.

My father was not against this decision, but he advised me to pursue graduation with a professional degree. You don't have to depend on others for a job and can start your own business. With a little reluctance, I joined **B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering at Guru Nanak Dev University in 2016**.

Within two months, I realized that instead of crying over the spilled milk, I need to put my effort into what I am doing right. I am not going to blame someone else for my failure.

During the first semester of my graduation, I learned about **Python** and started enjoying it. I quickly realized that Mathematics and Programming are very similar with **equations** in the former replaced with **instructions** in the latter with the end goal of solving a given problem.

During the third year of my graduation, I got selected as a **Google Summer of Code Developer for GNOME foundation** where I revamped the [GTK website](https://gtk.org) using Jekyll. This project was a turning point in my career as I got introduced to some of the best software engineers in the world. I learned a lot of things like good coding practices, technical writing, and open-source maintenance. I was invited to **speak at the GUADEC conference in Greece** but due to some visa issues, I couldn't attend the conference.

Thanks to this project, I started receiving a lot of roles for internships, jobs, and other gigs that you expect from a software developer. I took only those tasks that didn't require a full-time commitment and **started doing freelancing**.

In the fourth year of my graduation, I sat down one day and started to think about where I am going the take my life. Am I going the work for somebody else for a meager amount of salary or work on something that I love or get paid handsomely as well?

So instead of taking up the job offer that I was offered at the end of my graduation, I decided to pursue **Masters in Computer Science and Engineering**. I started my post-graduation in 2020 at Guru Nanak Dev University.

Then came **Covid** ü¶† and everything changed. My classes for my Master's were delayed by over six months. This gave me some free time and I thought of starting a digital product development agency, [RavSam](https://www.ravsam.in). So, I started reaching out to companies and started working with promising businesses and startups and provided them with [Full Stack Development services](https://www.ravsam.in/services/) and **Technical Content Writing** services for [various publications](/#-technical-content-writing).

As the date for my post-graduation came close, I started to fire up my job hunt. I wanted a fully remote role, and luckily the company that I was working with on a contract basis as an independent consultant, offered me a [role of a Software Engineer](/blog/starting-my-first-full-time-role-as-a-software-engineer) in Feb 2022 and I started my first fulltime job.

I know that life is unpredictable and a lot of things can change in a small period but I always keep in mind that:

**_The best way to predict the future is to create it._** - Abraham Lincoln

**_If somebody offers you an amazing opportunity but you are not sure you can do it, say yes ‚Äì then learn how to do it later!_** - Richard Branson

**_Amateurs call it genius. Masters call it practice._** - Thierry Henry

**_Only thing we have to fear is fear itself._** - Franklin D. Roosevelt

**_You miss 100 percent of the shots you never take._** - Wayne Gretzky

**_If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it._** - Drake

**_Do not pray for easy lives, pray to be stronger men._** - John F. Kennedy

## üéπ Music

Sometimes I decide to get away from tech life and dive straight into music production. I have [my Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/ravdmusic), where you can listen to my remixes and originals.

## ‚öΩÔ∏è Sports

**_All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy_**. So, I go out with my friends to play outdoor sports like Cricket, Football, and more. I love to cycle around my city and try to ride at least 10-15 km a day.

## üì´ Newsletter

I publish a monthly [newsletter](https://www.ravsam.in/newsletter/) with **400+ subscribers** in which I share personal stories, projects that I am working on, and what is happening in the world of tech, and some interesting dev related posts which I come across while surfing on the web.

## ‚òéÔ∏è Get In Touch

Whether you are a student or a CEO, my inbox is open to everyone. I'd love to help you in any way possible. If you have an interesting project for me, please get in touch for a discussion. I am **open to working with startups and businesses that offer remote work**.
