I was born on **19 April 1998** in the holy city of **Amritsar, Punjab, India**.

I did my schooling at **Manav Public School** in my hometown.

Ever since I was young, I was fascinated by computers maybe because **my father was a software engineer**. The sound of mechanical keyboards was music to my ear and I would press keys for fun. I made a **Railway Ticket Booking system** in Visual Basics when I was in sixth grade. That is my first memory of writing code.

In school, I was excellent at Mathematics and **scored 99/100** in my final high school exams. I enjoyed Mathematics because, unlike other subjects, **I didn't have to cram it**. It was more about understanding the problem and then solving it. So, I thought of doing my graduation in Mathematics.

My father was not against this decision, but he advised me to pursue graduation with a professional degree. You don't have to depend on others for a job and can start your own business. With a little reluctance, I joined **B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering at Guru Nanak Dev University in 2016**.

Within two months, I realized that instead of crying over the spilled milk, I need to put my effort into what I am doing right. I am not going to blame someone else for my failure.

During the first semester of my graduation, I learned about **Python** and started enjoying it. I quickly realized that Mathematics and Programming are very similar with **equations** in former replaced with **instructions** in latter with the end goal of solving a given problem.

During the third year of my graduation, I got selected as a **Google Summer of Code Developer for GNOME foundation** where I revamped the [GTK website](https://gtk.org) using Jekyll. This project was a turning point in my career as I got introduced to some of the best software engineers in the world. I learned a lot of things like good coding practices, technical writing, open-source maintenance. I was invited to **speak at the GUADEC conference in Greece** but due to some visa issues, I couldn't attend the conference.

Thanks to this project, I started receiving a lot of roles for internships, jobs, and other gigs that you expect from a software developer. I took only those tasks that didn't require a full-time commitment and **started doing freelancing**.

In the fourth year of my graduation, I sat down one day and started to think about where I am going the take my life. Am I going the work for somebody else or do something that I love? Am I going to do a **9-5 office job** or take control of my time and do whatever I want? The answers to these questions weren't clear but I soon realized that **teaching** - whether verbal or written - is something that I love the most.

The **passion for teaching** emerged when I was the **part of the Computer Engineering Student Society** at my University. I **taught Web Development to my juniors** and they gave great feedback. They acknowledged my teaching skills that how I can teach a complex topic with ease.

So, I finally decided to **pursue a career** which will help me become a teacher but at the same time allow me to do other things like freelancing, consulting, technical content writing, and more.

So instead of taking up the job offer that I was offered at the end of my graduation, I decided to pursue **Masters in Computer Science and Engineering**. I started my post-graduation in 2020 at Guru Nanak Dev University.

At the same time, I started my freelance digital product development agency, [RavSam](https://www.ravsam.in). Since then, I have worked with promising businesses and startups and provided them with [Full Stack Development services](https://www.ravsam.in/services/) and **Technical Content Writing** services for [various publications](/#-technical-content-writing).

I know that life is unpredictable and a lot of things can change in a small period but I always keep in mind that

## üë®‚Äçüíª Full Stack Development

I provide my freelance services to clients all over the world via my [Full Stack Development agency](https://www.ravsam.in). My first large-scale project was the revamp of the [GTK website](https://gtk.org) which I did as Google Summer of Code Developer. It was [greatly appreciated](https://twitter.com/GTKtoolkit/status/1230167481228107776) by the open-source community.

Since then, I have worked with many startups and made digital products for them.
Currently, I am working with [CloudAnswers](https://cloudanswers.com) as a Full Stack Developer and Consultant on contract basis. I am also passionate about design and user experience.

## üéπ Music

Sometimes I decide to get away from tech life and dive straight into music production. I have [my Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/ravdmusic), where you can listen to my remixes and originals.

## ‚öΩÔ∏è Sports

**_All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy_**. So, I go out with my friends to play outdoor sports like Cricket, Football and more. I love to cycle around my city and try to ride at least 10-15 km a day.

## üì´ Newsletter

I publish a monthly [newsletter](https://www.ravsam.in/newsletter/) with **300+ subscribers** in which I share personal stories, projects that I am working on, what is happening in the world of tech, and some interesting dev related posts which I come across while surfing on the web.
