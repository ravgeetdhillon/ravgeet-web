**👶 The Origin Story**

I was born on **19 April 1998** in **Amritsar**, Punjab—a city that feeds both the soul and the stomach (hello Amritsari kulchas 👋).

Growing up, I didn’t play with toy cars or action figures. Nope. I preferred smashing keys on a keyboard. It probably helped that my dad was a **software engineer**. While other kids were doodling with crayons, I was building a **Railway Ticket Booking System** in **Visual Basic** at age 11. Pretty sure I was the only 6th grader more excited about `Form_Load()` than field trips.

<br />

**🧮 Maths > Mugging Up**

In school, I loved **Mathematics**—partly because it made sense, but mostly because I didn’t have to memorize anything. While others were busy chanting history dates like mantras, I was solving equations and scoring **99/100** in finals. Naturally, I thought I’d become a mathematician.

But then came Dad’s friendly advice: _“Son, maths is great, but let’s get you a job too.”_  
And just like that, **Computer Science Engineering** happened. I joined **Guru Nanak Dev University** in 2016. Was it my dream? Nope. But was it destiny? You bet.

<br />

**💻 From Syntax Errors to Summer of Code**

Two months into college, entered: **Python**—the language that made me fall in love with programming all over again. It felt like solving math puzzles, just with more semicolons and fewer tears.

In my third year, I got into **Google Summer of Code** with **GNOME Foundation**, where I revamped the [GTK website](https://gtk.org). I learned about open source, writing good code, and technical documentation.  
They even invited me to **speak at a conference in Greece** 🇬🇷... but, plot twist—**Visa Denied™**.  
Apparently, changing the GTK website doesn’t count as international diplomacy.

But hey, that project opened many doors. I started **freelancing**—writing code, articles, and sometimes, existential tweets.

<br />

**🎓 Master's Degree & Mid-Pandemic Madness**

By the end of my B.Tech, I had a choice: take a decent job or level up. I chose to **pursue a Master's** in Computer Science (also at GNDU). Then came **COVID-19** 🦠, because of course it did.

Classes were delayed, so I used the time wisely and started [**RavSam**](https://www.ravsam.in)—a digital product agency. We helped businesses build full-stack apps and write kickass technical content. Basically, if your startup needed code or words, we delivered both.

<br />

**💼 First Job, Finally**

By early 2022, as I wrapped up my post-grad, the company I freelanced with offered me a **full-time Software Engineer role**.
I said yes. No job portals. No cover letters. Just consistent work and decent memes on Slack.

**🎶 Music**

When I'm not coding or writing, I’m making music. I post remixes and originals on [**YouTube**](https://youtube.com/ravdmusic). Think of it as code, but with beats.

<br />

**⚽ Sports, Sweat & Sanity**

All work and no play makes developers... weird. So I try to stay human:  
I cycle 10–15 km a day 🚴‍♂️
I play Football, Cricket, and sometimes Badminton (mostly losing, but with style).  
Touch grass, folks. Literally.

<br />

**📬 Let’s Connect**

Whether you’re a curious student, a CTO, or someone with a cool idea—I’d love to hear from you. I'm open to **remote work**, **collaborations**, and even **casual chit-chat** about tech, startups, or pineapple on pizza.
