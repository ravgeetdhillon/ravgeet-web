Komments is a Flask based web app to manage comments on your blog. It stores and retrieves the comments for each blog post on your DropBox App through Dropbox API. You can host it on any cloud platform you want. Only POST requests are served over a valid secure network. For more information on how to set up the web app for your blog, you can refer to this [README](https://github.com/ravgeetdhillon/komments/blob/master/README.md).
