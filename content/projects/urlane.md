UrLane is a project about handling traffic flow on the toll booths. I and my two friends, [Sharvan Sharma](https://github.com/sharvan-sharma) and [Robin Kataria](https://github.com/robinkataria) developed during the Hack Zero to One Hackathon 2018 organized at Guru Nanak Dev University. It was a 24-hour Hackathon and we got a **special mention** for this project by the judges. What it basically does is it calculates the vehicles in each of the toll lanes and directs the incoming vehicles to enter the lane with the least traffic. This ensures the smooth passing of vehicles and also lessens the time, a driver has to spend at the toll booth. This helps in reducing pollution as well.
