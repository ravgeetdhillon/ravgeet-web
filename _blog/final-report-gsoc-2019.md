## About

**Project**

Rework the GTK Website

**Description**

The ultimate goal of my project was to redesign and redevelop the GTKâ€™s official website [https://gtk.org](https://gtk.org) by providing it a design that follows current trends and content updation that really matters to the users and developers by using modern static site generators. This website uses Gitlab CI for deployment purposes. The project is a major milestone belonging to the release of GTK 4.0.

## Project Breakdown

Create a content driven website for developers with their skills ranging
from beginner to expert. Provide the up-to-date data regarding GTK. Focus on elegance and simplicity and at the same time have a great UI/UX. Make the content updation process so simple that even a novice can point out mistakes and solve them on his/her own by sending the pull
requests. Establish this by using modern Static
Site Generator such as Jekyll. Optimize the website for search engines.
