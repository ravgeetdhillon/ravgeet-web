Today is every special day for me. In my very first try, I cracked the Google Summer of Code. I am very delighted to have been given an oppurtunity to work for the GNOME Foundation.

My task is to rebuild the [GTK website](https://gtk.org). For those interested in technicalities of the project, the current website is made in PHP which is a great web language, however not so useful for creating static websites. So my job is to build a new website from scratch which uses the concept of Content Management System. I will be using Jekyll for this purpose and the website would be deployed using Gitlab's Continuous Integration.

It's going to be a great challenging summer but I am really happy to be handed over this oppurtunity. This summer is going to enhance my knowledge about Web Designing and it's future.

A huge thanks to all those people from GNOME, who selected me for this job. **Emmanuele Bassi** will be my mentor for this summer and I am very happy as I will learn a lot of new things from this man.

For future GSoCers, here is my [proposal][proposal] for the project: **Rework the GTK website**. If you need any kind of help or want me to handle your next project, you can reach me at my [email][email] or DM me on [Instagram].

See you guys in the next post.
