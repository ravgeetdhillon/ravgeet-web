about_me: |-

  With dream of being a developer, I decided to go for a graduation in Computer Science and Engineering at Guru Nanak Dev Univeristy in my hometown, Amritsar in Punjab, India. During my degree, I wanted to learn something that can help me show my creative skills and I can start earning as well. So I started out with Web Development as I was fascinated with the things that were running on the web and impacting people's life.

  Thanks to my love for Web Dev, I participated in **Google Summer of Code** for [GNOME](https://gnome.org) in the summer of 2019. My project was to redesign and develop the GTK's official website. It turned out pretty well and the website would soon be available at [https://gtk.org](https://gtk.org), once the GTK 4 is released.
