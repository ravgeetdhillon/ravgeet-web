      SteerAI is our machine learning project to achieve the ambition of self-driving cars. I and my friend, [**Sharvan Sharma**](https://github.com/sharvan-sharma) are currently working on this AI and we have achieved some significant progress as well. A blog post would be coming soon regarding our project. So to stay updated, you can follow me on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ravgeetdhillon) for more updates.

  - title: GTK Website
    tags: [web-dev]
    tools: [jekyll, gitlab-ci, jamstack]
    mini_description: Designed and developed the official website for GTK as a part of my Google SoC'19 project for GNOME.
    description: |-
      After getting selected for GNOME, I was handed the task to rethink, redesign and redevelop the official website for GTK during my Google SoC'19 participation. The old website was written in PHP. Updating the content was very difficult and it was not in relation to Open Source Website standards. So I stumbled upon implementing a website based on Jekyll as a CMS. I implemented a method to add GTK documentation, an issue tracker, Downloads and a community page. The website is currently served over Gitlab Pages using Gitlab CI. I was mentored by [**Emmanuele Bassi**](https://github.com/ebassi) and I got to learn a lot from his experience.

  - title: FantasyAI
    tags: [ai, data-science]
    tools: [python, github-actions, github-api]
    mini_description: A Data Science and AI project to play Fantasy Premier League.
    description: |-
      I am a huge football fan, especially the English Premier League. Also, it comes with its Fantasy Premier League which allows individuals around the world to play as managers and have fun for more than 10 months. It is so intriguing and unpredictable at times that it pushes you to the edge and tests your managing skills, patience, and your ability to foresee the future. So for 2019-20 season, I decided to write an AI that can coordinate with a human manager and give him insights on what steps to take, to maximize the team points. Its been fun writing this program and I got to learn a lot. The major selling points of this AI are its **cost managing** function, ability to make **decisions based on upcoming fixtures**, **player's form**, and give **transfer advice**. The above process has been automated using **GitHub Actions**. The results of the automation are sent via **Email notifications** to my mobile phone. You can read more about the project through this [blog post](/blog/fantasy-premier-league-with-data-science-and-ai-first-ten-gameweeks-review/).

    tags: [ai]
    tools: [python, tkinter]
    mini_description: An Image Analysis AI made in Python to regulate the traffic at toll booths.
    description: |-
      UrLane is a project about handling traffic flow on the toll booths. I and my two friends, [**Sharvan Sharma**](https://github.com/sharvan-sharma) and [**Robin Kataria**](https://github.com/robinkataria) developed during the Hack Zero to One hackathon 2018 organized at Guru Nanak Dev University. It was a 24-hour hackathon and we got a **special mention** for this project by the judges. What it basically does is it calculates the vehicles in each of the toll lanes and directs the incoming vehicles to enter the lane with the least traffic. This ensures the smooth passing of vehicles and also lessens the time, a driver has to spend at the toll booth. This helps in reducing pollution as well.

    mini_description: A PHP/JS app to show your Github Network in the form of connected node graph.
    description: |-
      This is one of my weekend projects that I like the most. What it does is, it takes your GitHub username as an input and gives as output your GitHub network comprising of your followers, and then their respective followers. It uses D3.js to create the graph and GitHub API to get the information regarding the user. The backend is written in PHP and the web app is hosted on Heroku. Click on the view link beneath to get a taste. All you need is your GitHub username.

  - title: SRT Convertor
    tags: [utility]
    tools: [python]
    mini_description: A tool to convert Video Subtitles into usable text format.
    description: |-
      I made this tool to reduce my screen time and extract something from something really valuable. A lot of times, I had to watch tutorials about different things which are 30 to 45 minutes long. The only thing that matters is the vocal content and rest is just garbage. If I view this on Youtube, it wastes a lot of bandwidth. So what I do this is I get a `.srt` format transcript of the video and feed it into this SRT Convertor. It gives me back clean and filtered file with only important textual information. So if you ever felt like the need to have a tool that can do the above, feel free to fork it from the below given GitHub repository.

about_me: |-

  With dream of being a developer, I decided to go for a graduation in Computer Science and Engineering at Guru Nanak Dev Univeristy in my hometown, Amritsar in Punjab, India. During my degree, I wanted to learn something that can help me show my creative skills and I can start earning as well. So I started out with Web Development as I was fascinated with the things that were running on the web and impacting people's life.

  Thanks to my love for Web Dev, I participated in **Google Summer of Code** for [GNOME](https://gnome.org) in the summer of 2019. My project was to redesign and develop the GTK's official website. It turned out pretty well and the website would soon be available at [https://gtk.org](https://gtk.org), once the GTK 4 is released.
