    As a child, I was always fascinated by computers. So to turn this fascination into a living, I am currently pursuing graduation in Computer Science and Engineering at Guru Nanak Dev University in my hometown, Amritsar in Punjab, India. During my degree, I wanted to learn something that can help me show my creative skills and I can start earning as well. So I started with Web Development as I was overwhelmed with the things that were running on the web and impacting people's life.

    I am a regular contributor to [GNOME](https://gnome.org). It is one of the largest FLOSS community in the world. I have a personal liking for this community as people here are very welcoming. By contributing to GNOME Web projects, I have learned a lot of skills and open-source practices. In summer 2019, I participated in **Google Summer of Code** for GNOME. I redesigned and developed the GTK's official website. It turned out pretty well and the website would soon be available at [https://gtk.org](https://gtk.org), once the GTK 4 is ready to be released.

    Whenever I get some free time, I divert my creativeness towards music. I own a Youtube channel where I post HipHop music and sometimes the remixes of my favorite songs.

    I love reading books and articles. They are a great way to break out from your routine. I read about people, technology, design and universe.
